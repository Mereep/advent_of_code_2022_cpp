# Advent of Code 2022
Yearly christmas-themed programming puzzles. Each puzzle has a input file (data) and two tasks acting on this data.
See the authors website [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) for more information.<br />

**Hint**: This is just for personal fun, please don't expect any quality code here:
I do **never** write C++ otherwise.


## Run
You likely need `cmake` to run. I am using PyCharm IDE which just builds it and compiles as is. 
You can try run `/run.sh` if you are on Mac or Linux. No guarantees it will work.
Needs C++11 or higher.

## Folder structure
- `./data`: Contains the input data for the puzzles for each day.
- `./utils`: Contains some utility functions (e.g, reading input data).
- `./days`: includes a class for each day having 2 functions: `part1` and `part2`.
